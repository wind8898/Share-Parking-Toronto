###### Painpoint of the market

It was a cold Saturday in downtown Toronto. Zepa was driving around the city looking for parking for school . She came across a safe secure parking lot that was affordable . 10 Dollars for 24hrs ! After class was done she realized that only 4 hours of her parking ticket have been consumed. What a waste ! At this point she turned on her phone downloaded SAT . In minutes she posted her parking ticket for $5.00 for the remaining hours . In seconds it was sold . Not only did she make some money but the remaining hours did not go to waste.
